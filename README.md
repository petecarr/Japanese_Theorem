Python program using tkinter to demo the theorem of cyclic quadrilaterals 
known as the Japanese Theorem.
Select a vertex (marked A,B,C or D) and drag it to another position on 
the circle.
Observe that the central quadrilateral is always a rectangle (unless you put the 
vertices out of order).
Exit using the Esc key.
